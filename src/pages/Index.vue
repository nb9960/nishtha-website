      <p>
        I have always liked making things, this became a professional career
        eventually.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like turning ideas into software products. I started this journey by
        teaching myself programming with C and Python. Then Java. Eventually I received a <strong> master's degree</strong> after studying in Sabanci University, where I took <strong> advanced Java, frontend development, Pyhton, machine learning and big data processing </strong> lectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently working as the manager of
        <strong

            >Collaboration Space</a
          >
        </strong>
        in Sabanci University. Collaboration Space is a university makerspace,
        where users make, think, develop and learn together using software and equipment like
        3D printers, virtual reality, laser cutter, CNC machines and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Makerspaces are interdisciplinary environments, where I had the
        opportunity to be included in both hardware and software projects. I am lecturing introductory courses in Java and Python languages to both university and high school students.
