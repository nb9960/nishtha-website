    <b-card title="Hi!" class="shadow-sm">
      <hr>
      <p>I’m an Undergraduate at the  <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi</a></strong>​. 
      An enthusiastic full-stack developer at my college’s premier coding club, 
      <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.copsiitbhu.co.in/">Club of Programmers</a></strong>​.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this journey by learning basics of web development in my school time and then after joining 
        college, I started learning C/C++ and Programming concepts like Data Structures and Algorithms alongwith enhancing my knowledge in the field
         of development. To dive deeper into the world of development, I participated in COPS summer of code'20 
         from there I got selected in Club of Programmers thereby increasing my love for Open Source as I used to 
         see my fellow developers contributing in various organizations. I am proficient in C/C++, Python, Javascript 
         and Dart, I also have good knowledge of Ubuntu OS and Visual Studio Code.
      </p>
      <p>
      I enjoy competitive programming, software development, attending hackathons and working on challenging 
      projects. I have been involved in software development and have grown to like open source from the past 
      year, because of its vibrant and engaging community. I actively use open-source software and like to 
      contribute back when I can. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I constantly strive to improve my skills and find new ways of thinking &amp; problem solving to stay on top of 
      recent technological advancements. I prefer to give more importance to practical implementations rather than 
      theoretical studies. I believe in solving problems by reusing the latest technological stuff, rather than 
      reinventing the wheel. I have been working in a startup for a year now and have come to appreciate the power 
      of teamwork.
